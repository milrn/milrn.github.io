Mod 26 is an Easy Cryptography challenge from picoCTF 2021. It has almost 280,000 user solves as of writing this.

# Finding the Necessary Shift

The question's description strongly suggests that each character in the string is shifted by 13. From my experience, Dcode is effective at applying cryptographic functions for encoding and decoding plaintext and ciphertext, respectively. Regardless, I selected "Automatic Detection" in Dcode, although it is easy to input the exact shift amount.

# Getting the Flag

I looked at the left column for the result and observed that the first one is the most likely choice because it follows the picoCTF flag structure.
